You are to design the UI for "Cordillera Weaving Marketplace" using React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn.
The visual style should be directly inspired by Bogdan Nikitin's E-commerce Watches Web Design (premium, elegant, minimal, high-quality imagery, refined typography, spacious layouts), but use the following custom Cordillera-inspired color palette:

Primary Colors:
- #E7EFC7 (light cream green – background highlights, section contrast)
- #AEC8A4 (sage green – section fills, card backgrounds)
- #8A784E (muted brown gold – accents, CTAs, buttons)
- #3B3B1A (deep olive – main dark background)

=== Style ===
- Keep Nikitin’s clean spacing, high-contrast product photography, and minimal shadows.
- Replace gold/dark greys with the given palette, ensuring harmonious contrast.
- Use deep olive (#3B3B1A) as the primary dark background.
- Use cream green (#E7EFC7) for light sections, headings background accents, and highlights.
- Use sage green (#AEC8A4) for card bodies or subtle background separation.
- Use muted brown gold (#8A784E) for primary buttons, icons, and important highlights.
- Typography: Sans-serif body text (Segoe UI / Tahoma) + refined serif or geometric font for headings.
