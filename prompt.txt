You are to build a full-stack web application called “Preserving Indigenous Weaving Through Digital Platforms” using the following stack:
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn
- Backend: Laravel (as API provider)
- Database: MySQL
- Deployment-ready code
- Storage for media uploads (images/videos)

The platform’s purpose is to preserve Cordillera weaving by enabling:
1. E-commerce for selling weaving products.
2. Digital storytelling through blogs, short films, and photo galleries.
3. Online fundraising via crowdfunding campaigns.
4. Visual media showcase with mobile photography and graphic design.

=== Requirements ===
**Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn)**
- Create pages:
  - Home: Intro about Cordillera weaving + featured products + featured stories.
  - Marketplace: Product listing with filters (type, price, popularity) and search.
  - Product Details: Price, description, cultural background, and buy button.
  - Storytelling: Blog/video gallery page with individual story detail view.
  - Fundraising: Campaign listing with progress bars, donation forms.
  - User Dashboard: Upload products, stories, and fundraising campaigns.
- Use shadcn components for UI (cards, modals, buttons, forms, progress bars).
- Fully responsive design with Cordillera-inspired colors and fonts.

**Backend (Laravel)**
- REST API endpoints for:
  - User authentication (Laravel Sanctum)
  - CRUD for products, stories, campaigns
  - Orders and donations
  - File upload for images/videos (Laravel storage)
- Payment integration for sales and donations (Stripe/PayPal, with placeholder service for now)
- Campaign progress auto-updates upon donation
- API follows JSON:API structure

**Database (MySQL)**
Tables:
- users: id, name, email, role (weaver, buyer, admin), password
- products: id, name, price, category, description, image, user_id
- stories: id, title, content, media_url, author_id
- campaigns: id, title, description, goal_amount, current_amount, end_date
- orders: id, product_id, buyer_id, status
- donations: id, campaign_id, donor_id, amount

**Additional Features**
- Image/video gallery with zoom and fullscreen
- Search & filter for products and stories
- Share buttons for social media
- Basic analytics for sellers (views, sales, donations)
- Multilingual support structure (English, Tagalog, local dialects)

**Deployment**
- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
- Backend: Laravel Forge or DigitalOcean
- Storage: AWS S3 or Laravel public storage
- SSL and CDN: Cloudflare

Generate code for the initial scaffold with clear folder structure and sample dummy data for products, stories, and campaigns so the UI is viewable immediately.
